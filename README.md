# React (WindyWinks)
This React app is your personal weather oracle! Want to know if that spontaneous beach trip is a washout, or if you should pack a sweater for grandma's house across the country? Just whisper the location (city, state, or country) and this app will consult the digital sky spirits, bringing you back the real-time scoop on temperature, weather, humidity, and wind speed.
